# Data-Analyst-Portfolio


# Introduction
My name is Denish Shrestha. I have been working as a Data Analyst for Infosys for around 3 years. The client that I am working with is Exxonmobil. Because of my passion towards data preparation, model planning and building, and communicating results, I am currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Data Analytics in the University of Houston Downtown.

I am sharing some of the projects I've worked on; I will continue to add more of them. Most of the projects that I worked on involved working with my Schoolmates and colleagues while some of them were completed independently.

The tools that I utilized to complete the projects are:
R-studio, MS SQL Server, Tableau, Excel, and python.

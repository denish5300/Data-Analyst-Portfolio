# Introduction
My name is Denish Shrestha. I have been working as a SAP Data Analyst for Infosys for around 3 years. The client that I am working with is Exxonmobil and I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in Data Analytics at University of Houston - Downtown. I have deep passion towards data preparation, model planning and building, and communicating results. 

I am sharing some of the projects** I've worked on; I will continue to add more of them. Most of the projects that I worked on involved working with my Schoolmates and colleagues while some of them were completed independently.

The tools that I utilized to complete the projects are:
R-studio, MS SQL Server, Tableau, Excel, and python.

## Project Overview
### Prediction of personal loan purchase
   **Motivation:** <span>  According to Investopedia, a personal loan is an amount of money you can borrow to use for a variety of purposes. One of the attractions of personal loans is you can use them for practically anything. The reason I chose this topic is because of my interest in applying predictive and descriptive models in the financial sector. <span>  <br>
